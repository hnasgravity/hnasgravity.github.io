## Abstractï¼š
The detection of gravitational wave signals, particularly from events such as GW190425, indicating a binary neutron star merger in the local universe, has sparked significant interest. The potential association of GW190425 with a fast radio burst, i.e. FRB 190425A, due to their spatial and temporal proximity has drawn attention, leading to the identification of a likely host galaxy, UGC 10667, albeit without confirmed kilonova emissions. This paper introduces a novel approach to identifying potential host galaxies using a comprehensive analysis encompassing gravitational wave data, fast radio burst details, luminosity assessments, and distance evaluations. Within this framework, an additional potential host galaxy (SDSS J171046.84+212732.9) was identified from the updated GLADE galaxy catalog, supplementing the importance of exploring the new volume. Moreover, leveraging luminosity and potential redshift information from these host galaxies can offer insights into various cosmological inquiries, including addressing the Hubble tension. Using our novel approach, we reduced the uncertainty of the Hubble constant $H_0$ by $\sim 30\%$ at the $1\sigma$ level, compared to the previous measurement based on the gravitational wave event GW170817 and kilonova AT 2017gfo. We expect to obtain even more precise results with future observations. In addition to resolving the Hubble tension, a precise measurement of the Hubble constant holds crucial significance in unraveling the nature of dark energy.
