description: GW230529 and the current status of LIGOâ€“Virgoâ€“KAGRA detector network; Hot topic and Journal club.

## Agenda:

- Junjie Zhao: GW230529 and the current status of LIGOâ€“Virgoâ€“KAGRA detector network


  <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this talk, I will introduce the observation of a coalescing compact binary with component masses 2.5â€“4.5 MâŠ™ and 1.2â€“2.0 MâŠ™ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal GW230529_181500 was observed during the fourth observing run of the LIGOâ€“Virgoâ€“KAGRA detector network on 2023 May 29 by the LIGO Livingston observatory. Moreover, the current status of LIGOâ€“Virgoâ€“KAGRA detector network is also included.
