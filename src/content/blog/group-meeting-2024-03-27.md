## Agenda:

- Zening Wang: Unsupervised machine learning for transient discovery in deeper, wider, faster light curves


  <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this report, I present an unsupervised method for transient discovery using a clustering technique and the ASTRONOMALY package. The paper  successfully recover the known variable sources, across a range of catalogues from within the fields, and find a further seven uncatalogued variables and two stellar flare events, including a rarely observed ultrafast flare (âˆ¼5 min) from a likely M-dwarf.
