  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this report, I would like to introduce the cosmological constraints by using the Pantheon+ data (Type Ia supernova sample) via MCMC method. There have 1701 light curves of 1550 distinct Type Ia supernovae ranging in redshift from z = 0.001 to 2.26 in Pantheon+. When including SH0ES Cepheid distances, it can get Hubble constant of H0 = 73.5 Â± 1.1 km sâˆ’1 Mpcâˆ’1.
